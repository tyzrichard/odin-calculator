this is cool

The final app of the Odin Project's Foundations Course, this got me to go outside my comfort zone and tryhard a little. This one is a cool little calculator app that has the following functionalities:
- Calculates Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division, with a Clear button as well
- Allows the usage of decimal places too
- A decent looking UI, using a pastel colour scheme
- And it also has Keyboard support! Just tap the display and type your stuff in.
- The calculator also supports negative numbers and rounds really small calculations to 3sf
- It also has some extras here and there, but I'll leave it for you to discover on your own :D
