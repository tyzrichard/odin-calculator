this is cool

The final app of the Odin Project's Foundations Course, this got me to go outside my comfort zone and tryhard a little. This one is a cool little calculator app that has the following functionalities:
- Calculates Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division, with a Clear button as well
- Allows the usage of decimal places too
- A decent looking UI, using a pastel colour scheme
- And it also has Keyboard support! Just tap the display and type your stuff in.
- It also has some extras here and there, but I'll leave it for you to discover on your own.

### Note: Don't try messing around with negatives just yet!
It kinda breaks my code, and won't calculate most of the time. I could rework my code to allow that, but thats's for a future update. One that I hope to actually carry through on :D
